# Hi, I'm Spencer!

Welcome to my Github page, where I showcase recent projects, both professional and personal!
I'm an MDS graduate with a passion for data science, machine learning, and language.

## 📚 Featured Projects


[Multi-Lingual Text Detoxification](https://github.com/spencerfliao/speech_sanitizer)
Online environments are often marred by the presence of toxic comments that can lead to negative user experiences. Our project develops a multilingual text detoxification system that efficiently transforms these toxic texts into non-toxic content, maintaining the original meaning and promoting a safer, more inclusive digital communication space.

[Goodsidian](https://github.com/spencerfliao/Goodsidian)
This is a tool that I've designed that will transform the books from your Goodreads shelves into neatly formatted notes in Obsidian, allowing you to showcase, collect, and annotate them in your desired style.
